## Project Overview

### What We‚Äôre Building

An AI-powered SaaS platform that provides personalized visa application guidance, document generation, and requirement optimization for travelers with complex immigration scenarios. Unlike generic visa services, this platform leverages advanced AI to handle edge cases and nuanced situations that traditional tools cannot address.

### Problem Statement

Current visa application services fail to handle complex scenarios like dual citizenship, various residency statuses, and intricate travel patterns. Users with non-standard profiles (e.g., Chinese citizen with US Green Card visiting Europe) struggle with:

- Conflicting guidance from different sources
- Generic checklists that don‚Äôt apply to their situation
- Manual research across multiple embassy websites
- Risk of application rejection due to oversight of edge cases

### Solution

An AI-first platform that understands complex immigration scenarios and provides personalized, step-by-step guidance with document generation capabilities.

## Target Audience

### Primary Market
